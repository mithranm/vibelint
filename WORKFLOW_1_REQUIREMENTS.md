# Workflow 1: Single File Validation Requirements

## Problem Statement
Implement a single file validation workflow that takes a Python file and runs validation checks against it, returning structured violation reports with actionable feedback.

## Functional Requirements
- [ ] REQ-F-001: Read and validate Python file exists and is readable
- [ ] REQ-F-002: Parse Python file into AST representation
- [ ] REQ-F-003: Load and execute validators from `src/vibelint/validators/single_file/`
- [ ] REQ-F-004: Execute emoji validator to detect emoji usage violations
- [ ] REQ-F-005: Execute docstring validator to check presence and format
- [ ] REQ-F-006: Execute naming validator to check naming conventions
- [ ] REQ-F-007: Execute complexity validator to calculate cyclomatic complexity
- [ ] REQ-F-008: Aggregate violations from all validators
- [ ] REQ-F-009: Sort violations by line number and severity
- [ ] REQ-F-010: Apply ignore rules and exceptions to violations
- [ ] REQ-F-011: Generate violation report in requested format
- [ ] REQ-F-012: Include fix suggestions for deterministic violations
- [ ] REQ-F-013: Calculate and provide file-level health score

## Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] REQ-NF-001: File parsing must complete within 2 seconds for files up to 10MB
- [ ] REQ-NF-002: Memory usage must not exceed 100MB for single file analysis
- [ ] REQ-NF-003: Validators must be modular and independently testable
- [ ] REQ-NF-004: Error messages must be clear and actionable for users
- [ ] REQ-NF-005: AST parsing must handle all valid Python syntax gracefully

## Integration Requirements
- [ ] REQ-I-001: Integrate with kaia-guardrails for file read operations
- [ ] REQ-I-002: Support CLI interface `vibelint validate file.py`
- [ ] REQ-I-003: Output format compatible with IDE integrations
- [ ] REQ-I-004: Configuration loading from vibelint config files
- [ ] REQ-I-005: Validator plugin system for extensibility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AC-001: Given a valid Python file, when validation runs, then AST is successfully parsed
- [ ] AC-002: Given a file with emojis, when emoji validator runs, then emoji violations are detected
- [ ] AC-003: Given a function without docstring, when docstring validator runs, then missing docstring violation is reported
- [ ] AC-004: Given poorly named variables, when naming validator runs, then naming violations are detected
- [ ] AC-005: Given complex functions, when complexity validator runs, then complexity scores are calculated
- [ ] AC-006: Given multiple violations, when aggregating, then violations are sorted by line number
- [ ] AC-007: Given ignore rules in config, when applying rules, then matching violations are filtered out
- [ ] AC-008: Given deterministic violations, when generating report, then fix suggestions are included
- [ ] AC-009: Given any file, when validation completes, then health score between 0-100 is calculated
- [ ] AC-010: Given invalid file path, when validation runs, then clear error message is displayed
- [ ] AC-011: Given malformed Python file, when parsing, then syntax error is gracefully handled
- [ ] AC-012: Given large file (5MB+), when validation runs, then completes within performance requirements

## Human Decision Points
- [ ] HD-001: User selects which validators to enable/disable in configuration
- [ ] HD-002: User defines custom ignore patterns for specific violation types
- [ ] HD-003: User chooses output format (JSON, text, IDE-compatible)
- [ ] HD-004: User determines severity thresholds for violations
