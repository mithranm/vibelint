# Quality Gates Framework for Vibelint

## Overview
Quality gates ensure systematic validation at each development phase, following the requirements-driven methodology. Each gate must pass before proceeding to the next phase.

## Gate 1: Requirements Completeness

### Purpose
Verify all requirements are properly defined before any implementation begins.

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] **All functional requirements defined** with clear, testable statements
- [ ] **All non-functional requirements defined** with measurable criteria
- [ ] **All integration points identified** with specific interfaces
- [ ] **All acceptance criteria testable** with clear pass/fail conditions
- [ ] **All human decision points identified** with clear triggers and options

### Automated Checks
```python
class RequirementsGate:
    def validate_requirements_document(self, doc_path: str) -> GateResult:
        """Validate requirements document completeness"""

    def check_acceptance_criteria_testability(self, criteria: List[str]) -> GateResult:
        """Ensure all AC are measurable"""

    def verify_human_decision_mapping(self, decisions: List[HumanDecision]) -> GateResult:
        """Verify all decision points have clear options"""
```

### Human Validation Requirements
- **Requirements Review**: Human confirms requirements capture actual needs
- **Stakeholder Approval**: Relevant domain experts approve requirements
- **Feasibility Confirmation**: Technical feasibility within existing architecture confirmed

### Gate Passage Criteria
- Automated validation score ≥ 95%
- Human approval from at least one domain expert
- No critical requirements gaps identified
- All acceptance criteria are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

## Gate 2: Implementation Quality

### Purpose
Ensure code implementation meets quality standards before integration testing.

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] **Code passes vibelint compliance checks** with zero violations
- [ ] **Security operations go through kaia-guardrails** with appropriate approvals
- [ ] **All automated tests pass** with ≥95% pass rate
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks met** within specified thresholds
- [ ] **Documentation updated** for all new functionality

### Automated Checks
```python
class ImplementationGate:
    async def run_vibelint_validation(self, files: List[str]) -> GateResult:
        """Run comprehensive vibelint analysis"""

    async def verify_guardrails_integration(self, changes: List[Change]) -> GateResult:
        """Ensure all system ops go through guardrails"""

### Automated Checks
```python

        """Test all cross-component interfaces"""

    async def run_end_to_end_tests(self, workflows: List[Workflow]) -> GateResult:
        """Execute complete workflow scenarios"""

    async def verify_human_checkpoints(self, checkpoints: List[Checkpoint]) -> GateResult:
        """Test human decision point mechanics"""

    async def audit_security_trail(self, operations: List[Operation]) -> GateResult:
        """Verify complete audit trail exists"""
```

### Integration Test Categories
- **Data Flow Tests**: Verify data passes correctly between components
- **Error Handling Tests**: Ensure graceful failure across component boundaries
- **Configuration Tests**: Verify configuration changes propagate correctly
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure integration doesn't degrade performance
- **Security Tests**: Verify security boundaries maintained across components

### Human Validation Requirements
- **Integration Review**: Human validates cross-component behavior
- **Workflow Validation**: Human confirms workflows match expected behavior
- **User Experience Review**: Human validates usability standards met

### Gate Passage Criteria
- All integration tests pass
- End-to-end workflows complete successfully
- Human decision points work as designed
- No integration-related performance degradation

## Gate 4: Acceptance Validation

### Purpose
Final validation that all requirements have been met and system is ready for use.

### Validation Criteria
- [ ] **All acceptance criteria verified** (automated + human validation)
- [ ] **Stakeholder approval obtained** from relevant domain experts
- [ ] **Documentation complete and accurate** for all new functionality
- [ ] **Regression testing passed** to ensure no existing functionality broken
- [ ] **Release readiness confirmed** with deployment checklist complete

### Automated Checks
```python
class AcceptanceGate:
    async def verify_all_acceptance_criteria(self, requirements: RequirementsDoc) -> GateResult:
        """Verify every AC has been validated"""

    async def run_regression_test_suite(self, baseline: TestBaseline) -> GateResult:

## Cross-Gate Quality Metrics

### Continuous Monitoring
```python
class QualityMetricsCollector:

        """Collect metrics for gate passage analysis"""

    def track_quality_trends(self, metrics_history: List[Metrics]) -> TrendAnalysis:
        """Analyze quality trends over time"""

    def identify_quality_risks(self, current_metrics: Metrics) -> List[Risk]:
        """Identify potential quality risks early"""
```

### Quality Improvement Loop
1. **Metrics Collection**: Automatically collect quality metrics at each gate
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in gate passage rates and issues
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate systematic quality issues
4. **Process Improvement**: Update gates and criteria based on learnings
5. **Validation**: Verify improvements reduce quality issues

## Human Decision Integration

### Decision Points at Each Gate
- **Gate 1**: Requirements completeness and priority decisions
- **Gate 2**: Implementation approach and trade-off decisions
- **Gate 3**: Integration strategy and conflict resolution decisions
- **Gate 4**: Release readiness and deployment decisions

### Decision Capture Framework
```python
class GateDecisionCapture:
    async def capture_gate_decision(self, gate: Gate, decision: Decision) -> DecisionRecord:
        """Record human decisions at quality gates"""

    async def query_similar_decisions(self, context: DecisionContext) -> List[DecisionRecord]:
        """Find similar past decisions for context"""

    async def update_decision_outcomes(self, decision_id: str, outcomes: List[str]) -> None:
        """Track outcomes of decisions for learning"""
```

## Emergency Gate Bypass

### When Gates Can Be Bypassed
- **Critical Security Fixes**: With explicit security team approval
- **Production Incidents**: With incident commander approval
- **Business Critical Changes**: With executive approval

### Bypass Process
1. **Justification Required**: Clear business case for bypass
2. **Approval Authority**: Appropriate level approval obtained
3. **Risk Assessment**: Risks documented and accepted
4. **Compensation**: Additional validation scheduled post-bypass
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete record of bypass decision and rationale

### Post-Bypass Requirements
- Technical debt item created for proper gate validation
- Additional monitoring and validation scheduled
- Process improvement review to prevent future bypasses
- Documentation updated with lessons learned

This quality gates framework ensures systematic validation while maintaining the human-in-loop decision making philosophy.
