# Human Decision Points in Vibelint Workflows

## Philosophy
Human-in-loop orchestration where humans make strategic decisions while agents handle execution. Not autopilot - intelligent assistance with human decision points at critical junctions.

## Workflow 1: Single File Validation Decision Points

### Configuration Decisions (Pre-Analysis)
- **HD-1.1**: Enable/disable specific validators (emoji, docstring, naming, complexity)
- **HD-1.2**: Set custom ignore patterns for violation types
- **HD-1.3**: Choose output format (JSON, text, IDE-compatible)
- **HD-1.4**: Define severity thresholds for violations
- **HD-1.5**: Decide whether to enable AI semantic analysis (if models available)

### Runtime Decisions (During Analysis)
- **HD-1.6**: Review and validate auto-generated fix suggestions
- **HD-1.7**: Choose which violations to ignore for this specific file
- **HD-1.8**: Interpret health score and decide on next actions

## Workflow 2: Multi-Representation Analysis Decision Points

### Pre-Analysis Strategic Decisions
- **HD-2.1**: **Scope Selection** - Choose which parts of codebase to analyze deeply
- **HD-2.2**: **Model Configuration** - Select which of the four models to use based on budget/time
- **HD-2.3**: **Analysis Depth** - Decide how deep to go (quick overview vs comprehensive analysis)

### Discovery Phase Decisions
- **HD-2.4**: **File Inclusion/Exclusion** - Review discovered files, exclude/include specific areas
- **HD-2.5**: **Vector Embedding Review** - Examine embedding clusters, label/categorize patterns
- **HD-2.6**: **Graph Analysis** - Visualize dependency graph, identify critical paths to focus on

### Model Coordination Decisions
- **HD-2.7**: **Model Output Review** - Review outputs from VanguardOne/VanguardTwo and Chip/Claudia
- **HD-2.8**: **Conflict Resolution** - Manually resolve conflicts between model outputs
- **HD-2.9**: **Consensus Building** - Use memory system to build consensus on complex issues

### Context Engineering Decisions
- **HD-2.10**: **Analysis Summary Review** - Review and approve analysis summary
- **HD-2.11**: **Focus Area Selection** - Choose which areas to focus on for next development steps
- **HD-2.12**: **Context Refinement** - Review and refine AI-generated context before external use
- **HD-2.13**: **Context Package Approval** - Final approval of context package for next iteration

## Workflow 3: Deterministic Fix Application Decision Points

### Pre-Fix Decisions
- **HD-3.1**: Choose between manual review vs automatic application (`--auto` flag)
- **HD-3.2**: Select which types of fixes to apply (emoji, docstring, naming, formatting)
- **HD-3.3**: Review list of proposed fixes before application

### Post-Fix Decisions
- **HD-3.4**: Review before/after examples of applied fixes
- **HD-3.5**: Decide whether to commit changes or revert specific fixes
- **HD-3.6**: Choose how to handle violations that couldn't be auto-fixed

## Workflow 4: Watch Mode Decision Points

### Configuration Decisions
- **HD-4.1**: Set file watching patterns (which directories/files to monitor)
- **HD-4.2**: Configure debounce timing for rapid changes
- **HD-4.3**: Choose between immediate feedback vs batched reporting
- **HD-4.4**: Enable/disable auto-fix for deterministic issues

### Runtime Decisions
- **HD-4.5**: Choose when to pause/resume watching
- **HD-4.6**: Decide how to handle persistent violations
- **HD-4.7**: Configure IDE integration settings

## Workflow 5: Smoke Testing Decision Points

### Pre-Test Decisions
- **HD-5.1**: Define which modules to include in import testing
- **HD-5.2**: Set performance benchmarks and acceptable thresholds
- **HD-5.3**: Choose external service connections to test

### Results Evaluation
- **HD-5.4**: Interpret performance metrics and decide on actions
- **HD-5.5**: Evaluate dependency resolution issues and prioritize fixes
- **HD-5.6**: Review configuration validation results

## Workflow 6: Validator Extension Decision Points

### Service Integration Decisions
- **HD-6.1**: Choose which external validators to integrate
- **HD-6.2**: Configure authentication and connection parameters
- **HD-6.3**: Set up rate limiting and caching policies

### Configuration Decisions
- **HD-6.4**: Define input/output format mappings
- **HD-6.5**: Configure error handling and fallback behavior
- **HD-6.6**: Choose integration testing approach

## Workflow 7: Experimental Branch Management Decision Points

### Experiment Design
- **HD-7.1**: **Experiment Goals** - Define what approaches to test and success criteria
- **HD-7.2**: **Approach Selection** - Choose which improvement strategies to try
- **HD-7.3**: **Success Metrics** - Define measurable criteria for experiment success

### Execution Decisions
- **HD-7.4**: **Approach Testing** - Select which approaches to test from available options
- **HD-7.5**: **Continue/Pivot** - Review intermediate results, decide to continue or change direction
- **HD-7.6**: **Results Interpretation** - Evaluate approach quality and rank results

### Branch Strategy Decisions
- **HD-7.7**: **Final Decision** - Choose next steps after reviewing all results:
  - Merge best approach back to main branch
  - Keep promising branch for future exploration
  - Reset to baseline and delete failed experiments
  - Set up A/B testing with parallel branches

## Cross-Workflow Human Decision Framework

### Strategic vs Tactical Decisions

#### Strategic Decisions (Always Human Required)
- **Architecture Changes**: Major structural modifications
- **Security Policy Changes**: Guardrails rule modifications
- **Integration Strategies**: How components work together
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Accepting degradation for other benefits
- **Experiment Design**: What to test and how to measure success

#### Tactical Decisions (Agent Execution with Human Checkpoints)
- **Code Implementation**: Following established patterns (with validation checkpoints)
- **Test Writing**: Based on defined requirements (with review checkpoints)
- **Documentation Updates**: Reflecting implemented changes (with approval checkpoints)
- **Routine Fixes**: Deterministic issue resolution (with verification checkpoints)

### Decision Capture and Memory

#### Decision Recording
```python
class HumanDecision:
    decision_id: str
    workflow: str
    decision_point: str
    context: Dict[str, Any]
    human_choice: Any
    rationale: str
    timestamp: datetime
    outcomes: List[str]  # Track results for Evidence-Based Reasoning
```

#### Evidence-Based Reasoning Integration
- **Store all decisions** in memory system for future reference
- **Query similar decisions** when presenting new choices
- **Learn patterns** from human decisions over time
- **Provide context** from historical decisions

### Quality Gates for Human Decisions

#### Decision Completeness Check
- [ ] **Context provided**: Human has all necessary information
- [ ] **Options clear**: All available choices are presented
- [ ] **Consequences explained**: Implications of each choice are clear
- [ ] **Historical context**: Similar past decisions referenced

#### Decision Validation
- [ ] **Decision recorded**: Choice captured in memory system
- [ ] **Rationale documented**: Reasoning behind choice is clear
- [ ] **Follow-up planned**: Next steps identified
- [ ] **Verification scheduled**: Decision outcomes will be tracked

This framework ensures humans maintain control over strategic decisions while enabling efficient agent execution of tactical tasks.
